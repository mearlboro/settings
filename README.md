This repository contains setup scripts for my current system,
PureOS Byzantium, working mostly with FLOSS software.

The desktop manager is Gnome, the window manager is i3wm with i3bar and i3status,
the terminal is Tilix, the shell is plain zsh with fzf and fzf-tab.

Special thanks to all my holy customisation buddies (in lexicographical order)
